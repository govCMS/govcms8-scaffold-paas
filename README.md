# GovCMS8 PaaS Project Scaffolding

This is a composer project which builds a Drupal 8 GovCMS **PaaS** site ready for
hosting on the GovCMS platform (Lagoon).

**Note**: If you are a new GovCMS customer visiting this page on
[Github](https://github.com/govCMS/govcms8-scaffold-paas)
you may prefer to wait for the GovCMS service desk to create your project in Gitlab.

For testing GovCMS separately to the GovCMS platform, you can create a project
by running:

```
composer create-project govcms/govcms8-scaffold-paas MY_PROJECT
```
